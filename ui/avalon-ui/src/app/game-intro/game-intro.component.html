            <p class="lead">
                The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization.
                Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are
                Mordred's unscrupulous minions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of
                Arthur's servants Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is
                discovered, all will be lost.

            <h3 class="display-3">Rules</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                Merlin: Merlin knows who the evil players (Assassin and Morgana) are, but he must be careful not to reveal his identity or the identity of the other good players. If Merlin is correctly identified by the evil players at the end of the game, the evil players win.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Percival: Percival knows who Merlin is, but not Morgana. His job is to protect Merlin and help the good players identify him without revealing Merlin's identity to the evil players.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Generic good guy: This character has no special abilities or knowledge, but their vote counts the same as any other good player's.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Assassin: The Assassin's goal is to correctly identify who Merlin is at the end of the game. If the Assassin correctly identifies Merlin, the evil players win.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Morgana: Morgana appears to Percival as Merlin, so Percival may mistakenly identify her as Merlin. Morgana's goal is to sow confusion among the good players and prevent them from identifying the evil players.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Generic bad guy: This character doesn't have any special powers but is still loyal to the evil team and wants to help them win. The player should focus on deceiving the good players and sabotaging missions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Oberon: Oberon is an evil player but doesn't know the identities of the other evil players. Oberon doesn't participate in any missions but can see who is on each mission and use this information to help the evil team. If the good team wins, Oberon can claim victory as well.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Mordred: Mordred is an evil player whose identity is hidden from Merlin. Mordred's goal is to sabotage missions without revealing themselves as evil and help the evil team win.
